* Tuesday
** Security Jam
*** AWS provides code jam to be used by organizations (in-house code jam)
*** Permissions boundaries are interesting, might be of some use in the future for certain users: [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html][AWS Docs]] 
** SDD319 Ensure the integrity of your code for fast and secure deployments
*** 3rd party services available in AWS Marketplace for use in cloud.
*** DevSecOps instead of DevOps (Security policy at every point, Build, Text, Distribute, Monitor)
*** Precommit - Threat modeling, initial SAST (Veracode), code review
*** Commit - Compile/build checks, SCA container security (WhiteSource), Unit tests
**** Container Vulnerability Analysis scanners (Aqua)
*** Acceptance stage - Secure infra build, functional testing, SCA, DAST, Unit testing
**** Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (Qualys)
*** Deploy - Provision runtime env, config management, RASP
**** Runtime Application Self-Protection (Prevoty)
*** Compliance - Automate it
*** In summary: Continuous Compliance, SAST, DAST, SCA, CVA, RASP

** FND310 How encryption works in AWS
*** Minimize unauthorized physical access (AWS): data in transport (on the wire, etc ...), data at rest (encryption), data in use (prevent hands on access)
*** Minimize unauthorized logical access (Veracity): data in transport (VPC, encryption on the wire), data at rest (encryption with AWS keys), data in use (remote reads)
*** Access keys under our control
**** MFA, cli password, api signing keys
**** You alone can create/modify/delete resource permissions
**** You have access to an audit event for every use of a credential or change to its state
*** Encryption keys/certs under our control
**** Keys are durable
***** You trust AWS not to lose them
***** Maybe a secure copy outside the cloud (probably not lol)
**** Keys are highly available
**** You alone can create/modify/delete permissions to use keys
**** You have access to an audit event for every use of a key or change to its state
*** AWS crypto stack
**** Physical - Secure facilities and optical encryption using AES-256
**** Data link layer - MACsec AES-256
**** Network Layer - VPC Encryption | Cross-Region Paring | Amazon VPN
**** Transport Layer - Amazon s2n | NLB-TLS | ALB | Cloudfront 
**** ...
*** ACM - public certs for ALB, cloudfront, etc ...  Manage PKI (typically painful)
*** Exportable private certificates in ACM (used in EC2 instances, containers, IoT, etc ...).  Can handle PKI same way for public certs
*** ELB (or other resource) talks to both ACM and KMS in order to provision certificates for signing
*** s2n - TLS library to help with transport security
**** Used by all AWS services.
**** Is formally verified (pretty awesome)
**** Probably too low level for us to care
*** Symmetric key encryption for data at rest (AES-256)
**** Encrypted symmetric key is stored along with data (encrypted with a master key)
**** Plaintext keys in key hierarchy are stored in KMS (for unraveling keys for decryption)
*** Client side encryption
**** Encrypt before submitting to AWS
**** supply keys or use keys in KMS
*** Server-side encryption - just let AWS do it.
*** AWS Encryption SDK
**** Just need to know file stream location and key location (key provider)
**** Can encrypt with different keys in different regions
**** Cache data keys for re-use without calling to AWS
**** Available in C, Java, Python and CLI
*** Data key for each object, etc ... (could be billions of keys in S3, etc....) | master keys for a large number of data keys 
*** master keys encrypt data keys, keys on Hardened Security Modules (generated and kept entirely in memory in the data center) decrypt master keys .
**** No AWS operator can access HSM host
**** No software updates allowed
**** Updates have to pass extensive review and verification.  No keys are stored durably on the host, so reboots nuke keys.
**** Ultra-hardcore about security here.
**** SOC 1 - 3rd party verification on the above claims
*** Every customer master key has a key policy integrated into IAM.
*** EC2/EBS Model: Unique data key is provisioned and stored in volatile memory (only alive as long as resource exists).
*** S3 model: Data keys used in volatile memory for short periods of time
*** EC2 contains key pair that is provisioned on startup (nitro card, very cool).  This key is used to encrypt, transport and then decrypt data key.
*** All KMS usage is logged in CloudTrail
*** TONS of 3rd party compliance auditing done on this

* Wednesday
** SEP316 Firecracker: Secure and Fast MicroVMS
*** microVM (written in Rust)
*** Packs servers with multiple workloads, they're trying to maximize workload efficiency per instance using statistical inference (pretty fascinating)
*** Needed flexible VMs to run under AWS Lambda
*** KVM-based virtualization (unique kernel, no kernel sharing)
*** < 125 ms to launch, 150 microVMs per second per host 0_0 | < 5 MB memory footprint per VM
*** Host-facing REST API
*** Lambda worker - provisions environment for customer code execution (sandboxed)
*** Old Architecture
**** Customer code (One function)
**** Lambda runtime (One function)
**** Sandbox (One function)
**** Guest OS (One Account)
**** --- /\ Runs on EC2 Instances /\ ---
**** Hypervisor (One Account)
**** Host OS (Amazon Linux) (Many Account)
**** Hardware (Many Account)
*** Guest OS is shared for multiple functions, but only one AWS account
*** New Architecture (Can run multiple accounts per bare metal instance)
**** Customer code (One function)
**** Lambda runtime (One function)
**** Sandbox (One function)
**** Guest OS (One Account)
**** Hypervisor (Many Account)
**** Host OS (Amazon Linux) (Many Account)
**** --- /\ Can run multiple accounts on Bare Metal EC2 Instances /\ ---
**** Hardware (Many Account)
*** Eliminates need for "Warm Pools" (pre-warmed VMs)
*** Probably the future: light as a container, secure as a VM
